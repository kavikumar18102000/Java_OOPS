/*
Stream can be used only once --> stream can be consumed only once.

* A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
* Streams donâ€™t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
* Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations
  can be pipelined. Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.


* The Stream API in Java is a powerful feature introduced in Java 8 that provides a functional programming style for
processing collections of data. It allows you to perform aggregate operations on collections, such as filtering,
mapping, reducing, and sorting, in a concise and declarative manner.

* The Stream API operates on streams, which are sequences of elements. A stream represents a pipeline of operations
that can be performed on a data source, such as a collection or an array. These operations can be divided into
intermediate operations and terminal operations.

* Intermediate operations are operations that transform a stream into another stream. Examples of intermediate
operations include filtering elements based on a condition, mapping elements to a different type, or sorting elements.

* Terminal operations are operations that produce a result or a side-effect, and they mark the end of the stream.
Examples of terminal operations include collecting the stream elements into a collection, finding the maximum or
minimum value, or performing a reduction operation.

* The Stream API promotes a functional programming paradigm by emphasizing immutability and the avoidance of side-effects.
It encourages writing code that is more concise, readable, and expressive.

"Overall, the Stream API provides a more elegant and functional approach to processing collections in Java, making
code more readable, expressive, and efficient."
